This means when new data appears then it can be easily classified into a well suite category by using K- NN algorithm.\n\n#### K-NN algorithm can be used for Regression as well as for Classification but mostly it is used for the Classification problems.\n\n#### K-NN is a non-parametric algorithm, which means it does not make any assumption on underlying data.\n\n#### It is also called a lazy learner algorithm because it does not learn from the training set immediately instead it stores the dataset and at the time of classification, it performs an action on the dataset.\n\n#### KNN algorithm at the training phase just stores the dataset and when it gets new data, then it classifies that data into a category that is much similar to the new data.\n\n#### Example: Suppose, we have an image of a creature that looks similar to cat and dog, but we want to know either it is a cat or dog. So for this identification, we can use the KNN algorithm, as it works on a similarity measure. Our KNN model will find the similar features of the new data set to the cats and dogs images and based on the most similar features it will put it in either cat or dog category.\n\n","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"How does K-NN work?\nThe K-NN working can be explained on the basis of the below algorithm:\n**\n* Step-1: Select the number K of the neighbors\n* Step-2: Calculate the Euclidean distance of K number of neighbors\n* Step-3: Take the K nearest neighbors as per the calculated Euclidean distance.\n* Step-4: Among these k neighbors, count the number of the data points in each category.\n* Step-5: Assign the new data points to that category for which the number of the neighbor is maximum.\n* Step-6: Our model is ready.# **","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Suppose we have a new data point and we need to put it in the required category.
